## Code for the project Chat App

This is a private repo because we want our students to write the code themselves as much as possible. Only the coaches have access to private repos in this GitHub organisation.

The Chat App project has three levels of difficulty: 
* advanced (challenge: build the app with hard-coded responses for one side, and dynamic messages that are input by user, and show this on the screen)
* graduates (challenge: deploy app using Heroku or Netlify)

This repo provides the code for the app.

Suggestions are always welcome (henriette@migracode.org).
