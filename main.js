// create message elements that are added as nodes/child elements

// the class should be message-left if the message is a hard-coded message that
//   is randomly taken from the 'replies' array
// the class should be message-right if the message is entered dynamically by the user

// the input area needs to have functionality: message text to be grabbed and added
//    to the message-right element and button submit function
